          <p>The coffee house is known by different named being: al-maqhah in Arabic, qahveh-khaneh in Persian or Kahvehane or kıraathane in Turkish, Kafano in the old state of Yugoslavia, café in French/Portuguese, cafetería in Spanish, caffè in Italian and Kaffeehaus in German.

Since the 15th century, the coffee house was largely a center of social interaction and traditionally a place where men would assemble to drink coffee and entertain themselves with conversation, music, reading and playing chess </p>

        </div>

        <div>

          <p>Coffee houses have been given various names at times during its long history beginning with the early Ottoman description of;
‘Schools of Wisdom’ (A meeting places of men of arts and literature), then
‘Penny Universities’ in England (They became popular forums for the learned and the not-so-learned to discuss all manner of topics including politics and current affairs and a penny was the price of a cup of coffee)
'Seminaries of Sedition’ in England (A view held by the authorities who saw them as anti-social and ordered them closed in 1675 due to The Women’s Petition Against Coffee. From 1663 the coffee house in England had to be licensed.)  and
‘KaffeeKlatsch’ in Germany (The derogatory term originally coined to describe a women’s gossip session at afternoon coffee. It has since been broadened to mean relaxed conversation in general)</p>
<div>
          <p>
Following its establishment in Istanbul, this new place of social gathering found its way to Europe in the 17th century and then on to the world leading us to our present day adaptations with the likes of Starbucks.

While many of the significant and historic coffee houses of the past have since disappeared, a few are still with us and continue to serve patrons today. Here is a world roundup of some of the significant ones that have survived and some that have not.</p>

        <h1>Coffee belt</h1>

        <p>Sounds like a type of punishment but the coffee belt is a section of the world that has the best conditions for coffee plants. They simply love living in the middle of the globe, either side of the equator. Countries like Ethiopia, Indonesia, Brazil and Papua New Guinea (and others) all have the right temperature and perfect amount of rainfall to keep coffee plants smiling. This usually means an average temperature of 20°C, rich fertile soil and moderate amount of rain.
In subtropical areas, such as Brazil and Zimbabwe, the rainy seasons and dry seasons are quite different and coffee plants are grown at high altitudes. Equatorial regions experience more rainfall resulting in continuous flowering. In these areas, there’s not as much difference between the seasons. It’s more like the highest rainfall vs the lowest rainfall that defines the coffee plant’s life cycle.</p>


          <h1>Coffee world’s biggest producers</h1>
          <p>Brazil – in 2014 this amazing country produced 2,720,520,000 kg of beans & it has comfortably held the number one position for 100 years!
Vietnam – a bit of a surprise, Vietnam sold 1,650,000,000 kg of coffee in 2014
Colombia – this famous coffee-growing nations sold 750,000,000 kg in the same year
Indonesia – one of our nearest neighbours, this tiny nation produced 540,000,000 kg in 2014
Ethiopia – the birthplace of coffee, in 2014, this country sold 397,500,000 kg of beans
India – another surprise inclusion, India produced 344,760,000 kg of coffee in 2014
Honduras – down from the previous year, in 2014 Honduras produced 279,000,000 kg of beans
Mexico – growing predominantly high end Arabica beans, Mexico sold 240,000,000 kg of this beautiful coffee in 2014
Uganda – a central part of this nation’s economy, in 2014 Uganda sold 240,000,000 kg of beans
Guatemala – last but not least, this country is pretty consistent with its numbers, selling 210,000 kg of beans in 2014.</p>

      <h2>317 South Broadway, Downtown, Los Angeles, California 90013. USA</h2>
      <div class="desc">“G&B is lucky to exist, and at the same time, they’re at the forefront of what’s being done with coffee service, which I think you can say about any business doing anything innovative or new in food. They lucked into an amazing location at Grand Central Market, because for the first time someone saw them as Angelenos in a sea of coffee companies from elsewhere trying to infiltrate the LA coffee market [neither G nor B is from Los Angeles]. The service is casual. You come as you are; they meet you halfway. They somehow manage this dance while maintaining really high quality in the cup, which no one else had really cracked the code to until G&B. They seem to want to rewrite the way everything has been done in coffee to this point, including how much a barista can produce, which has been an amazing thing to observe, but as a customer, all they ask is that you approach the bar instead of queuing in line—the rest is really seamless.” — Ben Kaminsky</div>

      <h2>31–33 Rue Juliette Dodu, 10th Arrondissement, Paris 75010. France</h2>
      <div class="desc">It seemed like the talented team behind Belleville Brûlerie was holding out from opening a traditional retail business. Many of the city’s finest cafes already relied on their beans. But in 2016, owners Thomas Lehoux and American expat David Nigel Flynn proved to their fans in the Tenth that their wait was not in vain: La Fontaine De Belleville became the first contemporary specialty cafe to open in Paris in the style of a traditional Parisian cafe. The classically styled corner spot is filled with the vintage charm (and delicious food) you’d expect from the city – replete with a smoker-filled patio – but with, in a new twist, brilliant coffee alongside. And there is wine.e</div>

      <div class="desc">“The single-origin espresso program at Heart Coffee Roasters is among the most innovative and chance taking I’ve found. They’re out there on the bleeding edge of light roasts, especially in America, and they’re serving these enormous long espresso shots in a cappuccino cup. It is just delicious. You can be innovative and take chances as long as you work really hard and make smart choices along the way.” — Jordan Michelman</div>

      <h2>Grünersgate 1, Grünerløkka, Oslo 0552. Norway</h2>
      <div class="desc">“Tim Wendelboe, as a shop, has an amazing story. Wendelboe designed and built it himself, which no one really talks about, despite the fact that it’s a beautiful bar. The drop ceiling (made out of amazing wood, because it’s Scandinavian) of the former space was repurposed as the bar itself. He sands down and restains the floors black every Easter simply because it’s the right thing to do to make the shop look perfect. The fact that the business has just never had to make a qualitative sacrifice is a product of the fact that he has deep-pocket investors who believe in him (and his marketing value) and also that Tim as a person is so well reflected in the shop. He constantly says, ‘Well, it’s my name on the shop, so I’m accountable if it’s not excellent.’ We’ll probably never see another shop like it, and as he will tell you himself, there will never be another shop (in Norway, at least).” — Ben Kaminsky</div>

      <div class="desc">“The best espresso has come from Heart Coffee Roasters. Wille’s perfectionist nature means the coffee is not necessarily consistent but that it continually improves from the first roast batch of the season to the last. He’s not afraid to make changes, and when he nails a certain coffee, it shows. Sweetness tends to be the name of the game for Heart, and I’ve had some really delicious espressos from that team.” — Ryan Willbur
